%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

%
%       \makeheading[\emph{Curriculum vitae}]{Your Name}
%
% will put an emphasized ``Curriculum vitae'' at the top of the document

\begin{innerlist}

\item Used Estimation-Maximization algorithm on Bayes Network to infer the zygosity status for each pair of twins based on 15,000 patient medical records in Java.
\item Identified 318 out of 9817 diseases that correlate with zygosity status by conducting a two-sample t-test for the concordance rates between identical and fraternal twins for each disease.

\end{innerlist}

\textbf{Parallel Seam Carving for Video Retargeting} \hfill Feb. 2016 - May 2016

\begin{innerlist}

\item Proposed a new video retargeting algorithm based on carving discontinuous seams in time that is scalable for large videos.
\item Implemented and parallelized the algorithm using OpenCV in C++ and achieved 1.8 fps on 400x300 video compared to 0.2 fps for our implementation of the original seam carving video retargeting algorithm.
